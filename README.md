# Binge Tracker

This is a social app where all show lovers can unite and talk about the shows they love. It is currently being written in Meteor/Blaze.

It is currently being written in Meteor/Blaze. This web app uses OAuth login for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. This web app also includes
my own implementation of a "typeahead". 

What this app can do now:
* search shows (connects to The Movie Database API)
* add shows to a user's collection
* remove shows from a user's collection
* update shows from a user's collection

Features to come: 
* messenger service / forum post
* admin page
